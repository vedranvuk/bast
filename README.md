# BAST

Bastard AST is lightweight model of top level Go declarations constructed from [`go/ast`](https://pkg.go.dev/go/ast) and intended for simple source analysis and code genration.

Traversing go source trees can get convoluted fast so bast gives fast access to basic type info of go packages.
